**Attractiveness index of Bike-Sharing Stations for Brooklyn NYC**

Prepared by: Vineesh Das Kodakkandathil, MCRP, Rutgers University NJ

The project is inspired by an article discussing the growth of nightlife and recreational activities in Brooklyn, which mentioned an increase in taxis and for-hire vehicles used for leisure. Curious about the status of bike share systems in the area and their potential for attracting more riders, the author selected major NYC attractions and developed an Attractiveness Index to determine where bike share stations could gain more users. Using various sources, including NYC open data, NYC.org, and Citybike portal, the author created a scoring and weightage-based index for each station. The final index layer was developed using multiple geoprocessing tools in Geopandas. Although originally intended for NYC, the project was narrowed down to Brooklyn due to technical limitations with Google-colab. The project includes an interactive map, an attraction heatmap, and tract-level maps showing bike and walk trips to work.  Now let's explore the map!
